    <li><h3>What is BOOK-RACK?</h3><h4>BOOK-RACK is a marketplace where students can buy and sell textbooks with their college campus peers.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>Where can I download or use BOOK-RACK?</h3><h4>Currently BOOK-RACK is available for download on the Apple Itunes App store for IOS devices, an Android version is being developed currently and will be available shortly.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>Why was BOOK-RACK created?</h3><h4>During the summer two friends, Rahul and Sanjay, talked about trying to create an alternative way to buying their expensive textbooks that were required for their classes. They learned from previous years in college that textbooks and supplies added up into thousands of dollars, and they wanted to create something that would drastically reduce that amount. So they designed BOOK-RACK to try and help solve that issue. </h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>What is the goal of BOOK-RACK?</h3><h4>BOOK-RACK’s main goal is to help transition the textbook buying process for college students into a more affordable model. This potential new model will help students by making college more affordable and accessible by decreasing book costs. Making college more affordable is the core of why BOOK-RACK was designed. If the Application can help alleviate part of a college student's book expenses, or potentially even eliminate most of the cost through a fair buying and selling price of used textbooks between students, then they believe their mission will be accomplished.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>How will a student’s textbook expense potentially be eliminated on BOOK-RACK?</h3><h4>By buying and selling most of their college textbooks through BOOK-RACK, except for their occasional new book requirements, a fair buying and selling price will be achieved in which students get more money back for their books they sell, buyers will be able to purchase their books for far below the price from their standard options, and furthermore buyers can resell that book on BOOK-RACK for a similar price they purchased it for, which then could nearly eliminating the cost of used textbooks.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>How do I buy textbooks on BookRack?</h3><h4>After downloading BOOK-RACK to your IOS device, open the application, sign up with your school email ending in .edu, and then search for the book you’re looking for through title or ISBN. Once discovered, if made available on your school's book marketplace by a fellow student, contact the owner through the reply/contact option on the book page to make arrangements to buy their book. </h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>How do I sell textbooks on BookRack?</h3><h4>To sell a textbook on BOOK-RACK first go to the + icon at the top right of your screen, and from there you have three options for posting your textbook. You can either use the ISBN barcode scan option, ISBN number manual entry, or manual entry of title and book. One option may work better than the other for you, depending on your book.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>How does the ISBN barcode scan method work?</h3><h4>The barcode scan is done by simply using the application scanner through your device's camera. Once the books is found, the app will fill in the title, author, picture, and basic information of the book. </h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>How does the manual entry work for ISBN numbers?</h3><h4>Manually enter the 10 or 13 digit ISBN number of the book into the search bar to locate your book, if it’s located it will fill in all the book info.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>How do I manually enter in the information of the book I want to sell?</h3><h4>Manual entry requires you to personally enter the title, author, and other information regarding the book. This can help if the ISBN lookup is not working for your book.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>How should I pay for the books I’m purchasing?</h3><h4>We recommend applications on your phone that will let you transfer money, but this is up to each individual and your own preferences.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>Where should I meet other BOOK-RACK users to buy or sell books?</h3><h4>We recommend public places, such as coffee shops, or on your college campus at your library or other popular school locations. Anywhere you feel secure and comfortable making an exchange, again though this is up to each individual.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>Is there an Android version?</h3><h4>Coming soon, should be released in late December 2016 or early January 2017.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>If I decided not to sell my textbook, How do I delete it? </h3><h4>Go to “My Books” in the App, on the “Sell” side of this section you will see all your books you’ve posted. Select your book you want to delete.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>When was BOOK-RACK created?</h3><h4>During the Summer of 2016.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>Who created the BOOK-RACK App?</h3><h4>IOS developers Sanjay Shrestha and Rahul Murthy. Sanjay Shrestha is a Senior at Saint Mary’s College of California pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Math. And Rahul Murthy is a recent Computer Science graduate from Saint Mary’s College of California.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>When was BOOK-RACK created?</h3><h4>During the Summer of 2016.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>What can I sell on BOOK-RACK?</h3><h4>Any books.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>How do I know how good the quality of the textbook is?</h3><h4>Make sure you check what the listing says on BOOK-RACK before contacting the user, but additionally we recommend confirming that condition with the user, and also flipping through the book in person before you purchase it.</h4><br></li>
    <li><h3>Who is responsible for book sales and any issue that may arise during the transaction of buying and/or selling a book?</h3><h4>The buyer and seller are responsible for any issues that arise during a book transaction. BOOK-RACK is not responsible for any actions or issues that arise from the buyer or seller during a transaction.</h4><br></li>
